# How to generate the datasets
Datasets used for the evaluation are too large to be uploaded on Github. Nevertheless, we provided code to generate them (the random seeds are fixed for reproductibility reasons).

Two files are available to build these datasets. A [Jupyter notebook](./construct_dataset.ipynb) or a [Python script](construct_dataset.py). Bboth files contain the same code and produce the same results. You are free to use the one you prefer

The generated CSV datasets will be placed in the [dataset](dataset/) folder.
